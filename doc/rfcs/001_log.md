- Feature Name: log
- Start Date: 2016-05-07

# Summary

Log plugin collects all log messages from all plugins.

# Motivation

Println debugging is the fastest but not the best way to generate visible
informations. For example, println logging would be difficult if we are in
rustbox implemented terminal GUI. Plugins of Swiboe can run as different
processs at different machines. A centralized logger can also help us to collect
all helpful informations between different plugins.

# Detailed design

Current dummy implementation stills uses `println!`. The following features may be
added later.

- Configurable log level.
- Configurable log target: not only to console output, but also to file.

# API

Each log function represents each logging level, with the same request and
response foramt. Currently four levels are provided, listed as follows.

- `log.debug`
- `log.info`
- `log.warn`
- `log.error`

## log.{debug, info, warn, error}

Calling these functions to send log messages.

### Request

- message: The message which will be logged.
- time: The timestamp in epoch format.

Json schema:

~~~json
{
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "message": {
            "type": "string"
        },
        "time": {
            "type": "integer",
            "minimum": 0,
        },
    }
}
~~~

Example:

~~~json
{
    "message": "Example message",
    "time": 1462677722,
}
~~~

### Response

Log function always respond an empty json object.

Json schema:

~~~json
{
